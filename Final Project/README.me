Description:

Subscription Manager is a web application designed to help users track, manage, and analyze their recurring expenses. In an era where everything from entertainment to software has moved to a subscription-based model, it is becoming increasingly difficult to keep track of monthly outflows. This project solves that problem by providing a centralized dashboard to monitor active subscriptions, billing cycles, and total costs.

The application allows users to register for an account, log in, and maintain a personalized list of subscriptions. By visualizing expenses, users can identify unused services and make better financial decisions.

Key Features

User Authentication: Secure registration and login system to ensure user data is private and persistent.

Dashboard Overview: A clean interface displaying the total monthly and yearly cost of all active subscriptions.

CRUD Functionality: Users can Create (add), Read (view), Update (edit details), and Delete (remove) subscriptions easily.

Categorization: Subscriptions can be tagged by category (e.g., Entertainment, Utilities, Software) for better organization.

Cancellation Management: Users can flag subscriptions as "Cancelled" to remove them from active totals while retaining the history, or access direct cancellation links for supported services.

Renewal Alerts:  Visual indicators or notifications for upcoming payment dates.
